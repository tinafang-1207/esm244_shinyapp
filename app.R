### 1. Attach packages
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(shinydashboard)
library(bslib)


fish <- read_csv(here("data", "LTER_reef_fish.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

inverts <- read_csv(here("data", "LTE_Quad_Swath.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

fish_inverts_kelp <- fish %>% 
  full_join(inverts)



### 2. create user interface:
ui <- fluidPage(theme = "theme.css",
                titlePanel("LTER Kelp Removal Experiment in SBC"),
                navlistPanel(              
                  tabPanel("About",
                           sidebarLayout(
                             sidebarPanel("Authors: Yutian Fang & Renee LaManna",
                                          br(),

                                          br(),

                             ),
                             mainPanel("This app visualizes data on fish, invertebrates, and algae over the course of 12 years given different treatments of kelp removal at 5 different

                                br(),

                  tabPanel("Interactive Map", h3("Interactive Map for users to select kelp, invertebrate and fish abundance")),

                           plotOutput(outputId = "treatment_plot")),
                ))


### 3. create the server fxn
server <- function(input, output) {
  species_select <- reactive ({
    fish_inverts_kelp %>% 
      group_by(year, treatment) %>% 
      summarise(count = n()) %>% 
      filter(treatment == input$treatment) %>% 
      filter(group == input$group)
      
    
    })
  
  output$species_plot <- renderPlot({
    
    ggplot(data = species_select(), aes(x = year, y = count)) +
      geom_line() + 
      scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2008:2020)) 
  
    
  })
  
}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)


### 4. combine into an app:
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
